SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data  
```

## Acceptance Crieteria
```GIVEN a social network API  
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application  
THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database  
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for users and thoughts  
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON  
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core  
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database  
WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core  
THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove   friends to a userâ€™s friend list  
```

## Installation

* npm init : Create package.json file and add dependencies and version once added.
* npm i express : To install express.js package for routing.
* npm i mongoose : Mongoose is a MongoDB object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment. It handles the connection between the API and the MongoDB database.Mongoose supports both promises and callbacks.  
* mongod : Run this command from gitbash to start mongodb server.
* npm start/ node server.js - Run this command to start an application execution.
